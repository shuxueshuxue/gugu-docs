When a turn ends not because the agent declared but because the API itself failed, this hook structurally marks the session `error`. A failed turn is a real outcome the board must show, and without this signal the session would freeze under whatever state it last held — reading as "active" or "awaiting" long after it actually died.

It is non-blocking on the failure event: the failure already happened, so the only job is to report it truthfully. As a board-lifecycle hook it acts only on a GOVERNED session — resolved in the global store from the payload's `session_id` — and writes via `spex internal session-fail --session <id>`. That machine entry reaches the same live-active compare-and-set as Codex's native failed completion and a headless turn's non-zero exit (harness-adapter): only an undeclared, non-stopped `active` record becomes `error`. A declaration, explicit stop, or archive that landed first remains authoritative; a late native failure never rewrites it. This one writer keeps the [[stop-gate]] family's invariant intact for every harness while each adapter retains only its native failure signal.
