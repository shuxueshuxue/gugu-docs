# @@@ mark-active - the SINGLE turn-boundary hook, wired to BOTH UserPromptSubmit and PreToolUse. It has ONE
# job, keyed off the session's global record dir: keep the declared FRESHNESS state honest. It carries no
# conversation — a message reaches this agent as an ordinary prompt through the harness adapter
# ([[delivery-queue]]), which is the only way anything enters a turn. A hook that also injected mail handed
# every message over twice and made the agent's context depend on which of two paths won a race.
# Freshness branches on ONE structured signal read straight from the hook payload (stdin JSON), so the state is
# HARD — never text-sniffed from the TUI:
#   the agent is pausing to ask the HUMAN (hp_is_ask) → status: asking, with the question text as the note
#                                  (the deterministic capture of a question).
#   any other tool, or a prompt submit → the agent is working → status: active (drop a now-stale proposal/note).
# WHAT counts as "asking" is the [[harness-adapter]]'s call (Claude: the AskUserQuestion tool; Codex: the
# request_user_input tool) — read via hp_is_ask, so this hook never names a harness tool.
# Fires BEFORE the tool runs, so a `spex session done` declaration (itself a tool) lands AFTER this and wins;
# the next real tool flips back to active, forcing a fresh Stop-gate declaration.
# @@@ read cheap, write through the ONE writer - this hook is on the hot path (every tool call), so it does
# its own READ in pure shell: three exact-line greps answer "already active, nothing stale to clear?", which
# is the overwhelmingly common case, and that path exits without spawning anything. When there IS a change to
# make it hands the write to `spex internal session-state`, the same structured writer the CLI declarations
# use. It never edits session.json itself: an asking note is arbitrary human/agent prose, and a writer that
# substitutes prose into existing JSON meets a quote, a backslash, or a newline and leaves a record nothing
# can parse — which is how a live session came to report "no session record" ([[sessions-core]]).
# @@@ global store - state lives NOT in the worktree but in the per-session GLOBAL record session.json, keyed
# by the harness session_id, grouped per-project (see hp_store_dir). GATED on `governed`: a user-self-launched
# (non-governed) session has no board to feed, so this no-ops on it. cwd = the session worktree.

# agent ACTING, so its calls never touch the record; the parent's own next tool call still flips. The
